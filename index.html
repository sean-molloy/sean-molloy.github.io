    <h2>Hello James Landing Page</h2>
    <p>Hi Raz and James, here are two possibilities for your website. 
      Please keep in mind that these are mock-ups, with place-holder images which 
      we will replace with new hi-res files.</p>

    <div class="linkBox">
      <a href="Version 1/index.html">Version 1</a>
      <a href="Version 2/index.html">Version 2</a>
      <a href="Version 3/index.html">Version 3</a>
    </div>
    <p>Both of these versions are made for mobile first, and are responsive designed 
      so that they will adapt to whatever device is being used to view the website.</p>
